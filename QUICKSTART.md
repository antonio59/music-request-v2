## Configuration (Optional)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```env
# YouTube API Key (for real search results)
# Get one from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Internxt Credentials (for cloud storage)
INTERNXT_EMAIL=your@email.com
INTERNXT_PASSWORD=your_password
INTERNXT_APP_KEY=your_app_key

# Change the JWT secret in production
JWT_SECRET=generate-a-random-string-here
```

## Installing yt-dlp (for real downloads)

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install yt-dlp
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install yt-dlp
# or
pip install yt-dlp
```

**Windows:**
```bash
choco install yt-dlp
```

Without yt-dlp, downloads are simulated for demo purposes.

## Production Deployment

This app needs a Node.js backend (not static hosting). Recommended platforms:

- **Railway.app** — Easiest setup, free tier available
- **Render.com** — Free tier, auto-deploy from GitHub
- **Fly.io** — Great for global deployment
- **Your own VPS** — Full control

### Deploy to Railway

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
2. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. Deploy!

### Deploy to Render

1. Create a "Web Service" on Render
2. Connect GitHub repo
3. Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
4. Start command: `npm start`
5. Add environment variables

## Troubleshooting

**Port 3000/3001 already in use:**
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill
```

**Database errors:**
```bash
rm -rf data/
node seed.js
```

**Can't search:**
- Without a YouTube API key, the app uses mock data
- Mock results include: Happy, Count on Me, Roar, Frozen, etc.
- Type part of these titles to see results
